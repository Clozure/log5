### Log5 - it may not be better, but it is one more

Log5 is organized around:

* Categories
* Properties
* a Context stack
* Senders

Categories organize log entries; properties control what gets written;
the context helps separate the forest from the trees; and senders take
care of _sending_ log messages to the right place(s).
